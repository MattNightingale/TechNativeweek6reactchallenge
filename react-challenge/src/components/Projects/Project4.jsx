            A React web application called Jammming. It leveraged my knowledge
            of React components, state, and requests with the Spotify API to
            build a webpage that allows users to search the Spotify library,
            create a custom playlist, and then save it to their Spotify account.
            Additionally this web app is deployed with Vercel at
            https://jammming-xi.vercel.app/ Features Spotify Login — the first
            time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask
            them to log in or set up a new account. Search by Song, Album, or
            Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into
            the search bar and click the SEARCH button. The app will request
            song data about the user's input from the Spotify library. Populate
            Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from
            the user's query. Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a
            track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of
            the track's display container. Remove Song from Custom Playlist —
            users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign
            on the right side of the track's display container. Change Playlist
            Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist. Save
            Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by
            clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY. Resources Because there
            was a focus on building the React infrastructure, Codecadamy
            provided links to the HTML/CSS and visual assets used for Jammming.
            However, they did not break the HTML and CSS into their components,
            and it was requirement of the project to create my own file paths
            and component structure. Conclusion I enjoyed this challenging
            project. As my first deployed web app, there was a steep learning
            curve and much problem solving required along the way: What
            components does the application need? How will the application
            handle state? What methods does the application need? How does the
            application hook up to the Spotify API? How does the application
            save a playlist to a user's profile? Overall a sucessful first foray
            into React.
